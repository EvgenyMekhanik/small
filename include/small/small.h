 * @brief Return an unique index associated with a chunk allocated

 * This index space is more dense than the pointers space,
 * especially in the least significant bits.  This number is
 * needed because some types of box's indexes (e.g. BITSET) have
 * better performance then they operate on sequential offsets
 * (i.e. dense space) instead of memory pointers (sparse space).
 *
 * The calculation is based on SLAB number and the position of an
 * item within it. Current implementation only guarantees that
 * adjacent chunks from one SLAB will have consecutive indexes.
 * That is, if two chunks were sequentially allocated from one
 * chunk they will have sequential ids. If a second chunk was
 * allocated from another SLAB th–µn the difference between indexes
 * may be more than one.
